# To-Do-List
A C program that allows a user to create a to-do list or upload a to-do list.  The user can manipulate the list in different ways, including to add to it, remove from it, and save it to a file to be saved on the local computer.  If you wish to test the 'load' option, please type in "todo.txt" as the file to load in.
